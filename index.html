  <p>
    In 2014, I visited <strong>30 cities</strong> in <strong>13 different countries </strong> and landed in California with <strong>$1.92</strong> in my bank account. 
  </p>

  <p>
    During my third year of college, I decided to do a <mark>solo Europe trip</mark>. Knowing that I wanted to do this, I worked 2-3 jobs on top of being a full-time student and an intern to save up for this trip. Until this day, I wouldn't change a thing! I met many of my best friends abroad, ate great food, had dope conversations about cultures and most importantly, learned so much history! 
  </p>

  <h3>Some cities I visited:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>London, England</li>
    <li>Amsterdam, Netherlands</li>
    <li>Paris, France</li>
    <li>Mykonos, Greece</li>
    <li>Copenhagen, Denmark</li>
    <li>Oslo, Norway</li>
    <li>Stockholm, Sweden</li>
    <li>Dublin, Ireland</li>
    <li>Venice, Italy</li>
    <li>Ibiza, Spain</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Here's the </strong><a href="secret.html"><em>secret</em></a> <strong>to traveling...</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Triphackr has outlined some great reasons why you should travel. The site is awesome because the content is consistent and I can tell clearly where the headings are. It also allows comments, giving users a way to connect with each other. On the other hand, it does not scale correctly. When I make the page smaller, the links tend to mesh together. It is also a super simple layout. I would love to see more CSS to make it pop!
